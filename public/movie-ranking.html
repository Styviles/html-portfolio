<h1>The Best Series According to Sandra</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>One piece</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. An absolutely fantastic and fun anime.</p>
<h3>Attack on titan </h3>
<p>An amazing anime! Has a great sense of world building, characters are 4 dimensional and the opening theme song is epic and fantastic.</p>
<h3>Death note</h3>
<p>This is one of the best animes to come out for a very long time. The storyline is amazing but not complicated or clich√©.</p>
